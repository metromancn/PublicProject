1
00:00:03,666 --> 00:00:04,966
and this is

2
00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:10,666
our first time we try to talk about yinyang and five elements

3
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:12,966
and to be honest

4
00:00:12,966 --> 00:00:14,500
i'm kind of nervous

5
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:18,600
when we decide to do this podcast in English

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,366
cause as someone who was born and raised in China of course

7
00:00:24,366 --> 00:00:26,500
i can speak fluent Chinese

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,966
but i can always fully understand what

9
00:00:30,966 --> 00:00:39,133
my master Frida says about Yinyang Baozi and five elements

10
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,600
but i think this old

11
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,800
but mystery Chinese system

12
00:00:44,066 --> 00:00:48,166
that can helps understand the people's personality

13
00:00:48,166 --> 00:00:49,666
and relationships

14
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:50,966
and of course

15
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:56,266
the left path just based on your birthday and time so

16
00:00:56,266 --> 00:00:58,966
i want to introduce my master Freda

17
00:00:58,966 --> 00:01:01,800
let Freda help us to go through it okay

18
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,400
ah thank you Karen

19
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,533
i'm not the master

20
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:13,300
i just try to work out with basic things about Chinese fast

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,466
and also the inner element

22
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:22,666
and to have more people to understand how it works hmm so

23
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,700
when we talk about in Yang

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,600
so um by my understanding as in of course

25
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,366
means negative right

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,166
young means positive

27
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:37,133
and and i think most of the western people

28
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:42,000
they already knew that that's famous the yinyang picture right

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,366
so is there anything else you can tell us about the yinyang

30
00:01:46,366 --> 00:01:47,500
frida ah

31
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:48,600
yes

32
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:53,566
i think the western people know the yinyang is from the taiji

33
00:01:53,933 --> 00:01:56,533
because we always talk about taiji

34
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,766
if you talk taiji with western people

35
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:01,500
and then you talk yinyang

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,533
they definitely and fully understand um yes

37
00:02:05,533 --> 00:02:07,766
and also i think in western country

38
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:11,100
actually they use yunyang a lot for example

39
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,600
oh really yeah

40
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,066
that's how uh they

41
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:20,200
they always say a positive thinking or hmm negative thinking

42
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:26,800
hmm even in Europe i had a friend in Europe in French

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,266
and they really really care about what you think

44
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:31,900
because they truly believe

45
00:02:32,366 --> 00:02:36,566
and what what you think will become the true or reality

46
00:02:36,866 --> 00:02:37,866
so that's why

47
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:40,966
they always training their kids

48
00:02:40,966 --> 00:02:45,733
or from the little is you always need a politic thinking

49
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:49,700
so they talk about the energy level

50
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,700
you know the a lot of things

51
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:56,733
and it it's bit quite it's like

52
00:02:58,133 --> 00:03:01,166
mind game but actually

53
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:07,733
i think it's not only inside the Chinese traditional system

54
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:13,266
and um i think in recent four years when we had cover

55
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:14,966
or even before cover

56
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,266
like for example

57
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,466
hiv test

58
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,266
and they will tell you your test is positive or negative

59
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,966
or even woman pregnant

60
00:03:24,966 --> 00:03:30,500
and they also use a positive negative to definition you have

61
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,366
the have child or not or you pregnant

62
00:03:33,366 --> 00:03:35,400
or not so yeah

63
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,733
so i believe in Yang is everywhere whatever

64
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:42,300
west country or east country okay

65
00:03:42,466 --> 00:03:47,533
beside this beside the the things you just told us

66
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:50,400
do do they know the the key

67
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,600
concept of the inyang

68
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,300
i mean the the balance

69
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:05,000
when when we explain most western people

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,066
they understand but they maybe talk a bit different way

71
00:04:13,566 --> 00:04:17,500
but but they they if you talk just simple things for example

72
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,500
you say you say that the in

73
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,700
the biggest inyang in the world is the sun and the moon so

74
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,766
yeah it's bit

75
00:04:28,766 --> 00:04:34,366
like you know the moon will affect the humans black stream

76
00:04:34,366 --> 00:04:35,900
for example um

77
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:40,733
i i listen a radio is um is talking about the moon um

78
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:45,933
how the moon affect the the people's um sickness

79
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:50,366
and um in their record they find um

80
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:57,400
they had more emergency um usually at full moonlight oh yeah

81
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,200
so so so

82
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,300
that means you know something happened is not just accident

83
00:05:03,466 --> 00:05:06,466
because they had a collective record

84
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:08,800
and they find it will be more

85
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,300
you know active

86
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,200
or maybe people more active

87
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,533
uh during the full mood more full mood day

88
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:19,500
and then maybe they go out more or they drink

89
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,066
or they doing some some exciting thing

90
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:24,733
or they cause their some some problem

91
00:05:24,733 --> 00:05:28,366
or they than in the emergency so so

92
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:31,733
it's for some reason but if you explain it

93
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:38,766
they actually they quite accept and understand oh interesting

94
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:45,000
interesting so that means not just i mean the eastern people

95
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,666
but western people

96
00:05:46,766 --> 00:05:51,900
people know people know the inyang affect our daily life right

97
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,533
yes but not really detail for example

98
00:05:57,466 --> 00:05:59,133
in in in China

99
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:01,166
we will separate like for example

100
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:04,766
the quite is in and the moon is young

101
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,900
and the correct you know like is is is uh

102
00:06:09,766 --> 00:06:11,400
you know it's uh

103
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,466
oxide you know the that that will know

104
00:06:14,566 --> 00:06:18,900
uh also separate or the the moon sound of course

105
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,900
our reset or the shuttle we shut the door

106
00:06:21,933 --> 00:06:24,500
we we call it in or we open the door

107
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,266
it's called uh the the young or like for example

108
00:06:28,266 --> 00:06:31,566
like dark uh bright uh it yeah

109
00:06:31,566 --> 00:06:33,733
it's bit like oxide words

110
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:38,533
even like you know the going down or going up or something hmm

111
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:42,333
um but that that not uh to to separate the detail

112
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:46,966
but uh in traditional uh Chinese we talk about India

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,100
that was separate

114
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,133
very detail you know

115
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:54,466
uh so that's that's a bit different yeah okay

116
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:58,566
so let's try to sort of understand it on a deeper level

117
00:06:58,566 --> 00:07:01,700
from from our our show right podcast

118
00:07:01,733 --> 00:07:04,800
so so next concept what do you think

119
00:07:05,266 --> 00:07:12,966
we should to talk about baazi or all the five elements

120
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:21,200
which one is better i think is uh the purpose uh we learn that

121
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,000
or we

122
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:28,866
um try to explain is try to let people to uh understand how bad

123
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:34,466
uh what is bad and how it working um so uh

124
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:39,500
so all the other element is based on this buzz

125
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,600
so we can just general talk about what is buzz

126
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,400
first

127
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:46,766
okay

128
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:55,300
so haha i only yeah i have heard about buzz this is this word

129
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,100
okay

130
00:07:56,566 --> 00:08:02,600
uh for a long time but actually before i i met freda

131
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,900
i only know maybe it's about the birthday

132
00:08:10,266 --> 00:08:12,300
the birthday and

133
00:08:15,266 --> 00:08:18,366
uh and people can know uh

134
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:26,200
their destiny about their about buzz

135
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:33,333
and actually not really even although not really even know what

136
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,933
the path forward at least the people can know

137
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,966
and what personality from the the buzz

138
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:48,700
so this is basically all the thing i knew before i met frida

139
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:52,566
but actually i didn't know how

140
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,066
yeah yeah

141
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:58,900
i can explain that uh actually

142
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:04,933
bazh has another name is for the uh four pillars of destiny

143
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:09,700
and we also call uh call it eastern country

144
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,600
uh horoscope because uh that word western people

145
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:16,400
uh can more easily to understand yeah

146
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,500
and each of the pillows is made up of two

147
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:26,900
charities it's heavenly stem and an earth branch

148
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:31,333
so it's repeating the way to the year pillar

149
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:33,366
month pillar day pillar

150
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,400
and our pillar but actually

151
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,766
in charge in Chi China

152
00:09:37,766 --> 00:09:42,600
the traditional history and when we count the days

153
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,766
we always use a heavenly system

154
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:49,500
and earthly branch to count every day

155
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,566
so that's why we had the name

156
00:09:51,566 --> 00:09:55,733
we call check your Huang li ah the yeah

157
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:57,466
the yellow color yeah

158
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,733
so what means the Huang li for us

159
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:02,166
if we check it oh

160
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:08,766
the funny is is about um that day and that time but for example

161
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:13,800
um um that that day could be you know the head year for example

162
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,133
this year is the dragon year is the wood dragon year

163
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:21,133
so then they had special months for example

164
00:10:21,133 --> 00:10:28,366
now we are in November so that's called pig months so um

165
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:31,566
but but that the um heavenly stem

166
00:10:31,566 --> 00:10:34,133
we have to check you know some special way

167
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,300
to get that but in Huang li you can clear see

168
00:10:37,466 --> 00:10:40,466
they are already right there so what

169
00:10:40,466 --> 00:10:43,300
what is that heavenly stem

170
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,566
or you know the earth branch

171
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:48,800
and they also had the day so for example

172
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,266
maybe uh today is uh

173
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:53,500
uh like yesterday

174
00:10:53,766 --> 00:10:56,466
uh yesterday is uh

175
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
uh i think it's dry them um

176
00:10:59,766 --> 00:11:02,933
um Dragon day i think today is a Snake day

177
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,500
and and for me is usually

178
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,466
if i meet snake day usually

179
00:11:09,466 --> 00:11:13,000
things will happen maybe you have to delay

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,566
but actually

181
00:11:13,566 --> 00:11:20,133
we it happened today i got a first forecast before this one

182
00:11:20,266 --> 00:11:25,066
and because we had new people to to organize

183
00:11:25,066 --> 00:11:30,166
so we had delayed few for few minutes and so so so

184
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,900
it's yeah it's quite interesting so they also had a time

185
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,666
special time for example

186
00:11:35,766 --> 00:11:39,600
when you check the Huang li and that time is like now

187
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,133
is nearly two o'clock and so uh

188
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:46,166
so actually it's called uh

189
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,066
the gold tan so so so

190
00:11:50,066 --> 00:11:54,133
that's why so when you check the Huang li so you will exactly

191
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,566
you will get this

192
00:11:55,566 --> 00:11:58,300
uh so this full pillar

193
00:11:58,333 --> 00:11:59,766
so so you will know

194
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:05,300
is today is suitable to go out or suitable to doing things

195
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,600
sometimes the day is no good

196
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,600
so it's not suitable to doing something uh for good

197
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,200
or uh for example

198
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,133
if you had shops

199
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:16,533
you need open then maybe

200
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:19,700
if the day is not suitable for doing that

201
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,666
so that that's the people check

202
00:12:21,766 --> 00:12:21,966
so

203
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:27,900
it's bit like you check every day's bus so it's different as uh

204
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:34,166
it's extremely philosophy for uh for you born in um

205
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,533
the which year

206
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:37,000
which month which day

207
00:12:37,066 --> 00:12:39,666
and which what was time so

208
00:12:39,766 --> 00:12:41,766
it's the same philosophy

209
00:12:41,866 --> 00:12:45,200
so uh for for the whole universe things

210
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:49,266
everything that has there but for example

211
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:53,733
if you you made something you

212
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:57,500
you made a cup or you made a clothes

213
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,866
and and the time you made it

214
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,700
it's the birthday of this clothes so so

215
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,766
they also had their story yeah

216
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:08,366
and i think in western country

217
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,733
a lot of people that had packs for example

218
00:13:10,733 --> 00:13:13,566
they had a dog chick maybe uh yeah

219
00:13:13,566 --> 00:13:16,500
cat or chicken or something so so

220
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,133
each animal um

221
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,900
when the time they born

222
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:25,666
they had their specific the special bus yeah yeah

223
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,366
so that's why we call the yellow Canada

224
00:13:28,366 --> 00:13:32,300
and to check what what bus is so

225
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,666
can i understand that

226
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:41,000
if people want to know today is lucky or not for you

227
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:45,066
you have you have to know at least

228
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:48,766
you have to know your own buds right before yeah

229
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:50,366
that's okay yeah yeah

230
00:13:50,366 --> 00:13:52,100
because the day for example

231
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,900
we only talk about this day for the one today

232
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,933
that day had the special bags

233
00:13:57,933 --> 00:14:01,466
and maybe it's not suitable for doing something

234
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,400
or you maybe more easy have outside

235
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,266
have an accident or something so so

236
00:14:07,266 --> 00:14:09,466
you can choose like oh is that today

237
00:14:09,466 --> 00:14:10,966
i need to go out uh

238
00:14:11,266 --> 00:14:14,466
know uh drive too much or something so so

239
00:14:14,466 --> 00:14:16,133
that's the key to uh

240
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:21,900
it's just this day tell you but for personally you had your own

241
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:26,966
you know the bus but you own fast maybe for this day is okay

242
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,400
but for some people maybe not okay

243
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:33,900
so that's why we also can choose like even this day is no good

244
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:37,866
but it's not affect you so much and you still can doing things

245
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:39,400
but for some people

246
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,200
it affect them so

247
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,933
maybe they cannot they they they doing the things

248
00:14:44,933 --> 00:14:48,066
but it's not a happy ending yeah

249
00:14:48,066 --> 00:14:51,700
we have talked about it before

250
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:55,566
because i one day when i talk with Freda

251
00:14:55,566 --> 00:15:02,900
i told her that i always was on uncomfortable in the August

252
00:15:03,066 --> 00:15:05,066
and of course

253
00:15:05,066 --> 00:15:06,866
freedom knows my buzz

254
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:08,200
so she said

255
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:13,133
oh maybe it's too much gold in August not good for you right

256
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,666
remember we call mental mental hmm

257
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:19,800
oh now go okay so

258
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,266
because i made this mistake i

259
00:15:23,266 --> 00:15:29,300
i i use another word gold to uh to say the mental in the wuxing

260
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:32,166
so i think it's a good time to let frida

261
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:34,866
tell us about uh wuxing right

262
00:15:34,866 --> 00:15:36,466
is is it a good time

263
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,666
oh yes yes uh so um

264
00:15:41,666 --> 00:15:47,766
yeah i think the the wuxing for carry you also know know bit

265
00:15:47,766 --> 00:15:50,600
do you know what the five element yeah

266
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,400
of course of course

267
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,966
at least haha

268
00:15:53,966 --> 00:16:01,466
at least i know what five element and because uh i did made

269
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:03,500
a mistake mis

270
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,966
mistake about the direction we i see the there's a famous

271
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,566
wuxin picture

272
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:16,733
and so freda told me that you better remember the five elements

273
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,533
from the wood right

274
00:16:18,666 --> 00:16:21,866
so the five elements wood

275
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,066
fire

276
00:16:23,733 --> 00:16:29,333
and soil and no gold is a mantle

277
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,100
right mantle

278
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,800
and the water this is five five yeah

279
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,100
hmm that's five yeah yeah

280
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,166
so and

281
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:41,766
and just five elements that had the relationship like uh

282
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:45,333
assist each other for example um

283
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:48,366
the the wood will assist fire

284
00:16:48,566 --> 00:16:51,400
and fire will assist the soil

285
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,800
and soil will assist mental

286
00:16:53,933 --> 00:16:56,100
and mental will assist water

287
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,966
and water will assist wood

288
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:06,333
it also had another relationship what does that

289
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,900
mean it's totally upset right

290
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,666
yeah yeah

291
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:11,466
of course hahaha

292
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,666
it's from the water

293
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:17,400
from water to uh mandal

294
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,566
to the soil to the fire

295
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:21,066
to the wood right

296
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,500
yeah yeah yeah

297
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,933
but it also has relationship for example

298
00:17:25,933 --> 00:17:27,766
they call the conflict

299
00:17:29,133 --> 00:17:29,900
oh yeah

300
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:35,266
it's bit like control like some ah yeah yeah yeah

301
00:17:35,266 --> 00:17:37,666
you mean the distraction

302
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:42,766
which which one

303
00:17:42,766 --> 00:17:48,566
which one we'd better to remember firstly is fundamental oh

304
00:17:49,766 --> 00:17:51,100
yeah you can use oh

305
00:17:53,466 --> 00:17:54,266
yeah

306
00:17:54,900 --> 00:18:01,466
okay so the mental restract could i use a restract oh

307
00:18:01,466 --> 00:18:06,066
you okay the mental restrict wood wood restrict the soil

308
00:18:06,066 --> 00:18:08,100
soil restrict the water

309
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:10,100
water restrict fire

310
00:18:10,366 --> 00:18:11,466
and of course

311
00:18:11,466 --> 00:18:14,266
fire restrict the mental yeah

312
00:18:14,266 --> 00:18:15,266
that's all good

313
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,666
very good yeah

314
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,600
ha ha thank you

315
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,133
that's a five uh relationship so um

316
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,000
so that's the beginning of

317
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,300
that so hmm so now

318
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:31,866
i can explain a little bit the five element and so first

319
00:18:31,866 --> 00:18:34,500
we talk about the wood so

320
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,700
i think in in this earth

321
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,366
and wood is the most um plant things uh

322
00:18:41,766 --> 00:18:45,266
in the world so you can go on morning you can see the grass

323
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:47,000
you can you can see the tree

324
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,566
see the flower you know

325
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:52,466
that everything is had you know the the green light

326
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,600
and it's for the wood so so for wood

327
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,800
they also um had like uh uh but but before uh

328
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,900
i i explained the wood um uh

329
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:08,200
i need uh

330
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,900
you know the uh talk about you know the the from the inyang

331
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,700
that had um

332
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,066
major full change

333
00:19:16,066 --> 00:19:20,666
so the full change is called warm the basic thing

334
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:24,300
we we are in our daily life or a full season

335
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,900
we call a warm

336
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:30,700
hot cool and cold so oh yeah

337
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:34,800
that's where the five element comes from it's from the basic

338
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:41,333
it's from the four season or the four direction so for wood

339
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,133
of course we will think it's spring

340
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:49,766
it's east and also for wood wood had the

341
00:19:51,933 --> 00:19:55,700
it's you know the special

342
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,966
you know the the the point is the wood will be extend you know

343
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:02,600
like if you plan something

344
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:05,466
and they had only had two leaves come

345
00:20:05,466 --> 00:20:06,733
come from the beginning

346
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,300
then they had maybe four or five you know

347
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:11,800
that they just can't expand you know they had a lot

348
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,100
of branch become thrive yeah yeah

349
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,966
and they also had a vibrate so it's it looks like it's alive

350
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:20,533
you know

351
00:20:20,533 --> 00:20:25,533
it's especially if you planning some veggie means the whole yeah

352
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:26,200
yeah yeah

353
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,966
you you will see the color and it will bring you say oh

354
00:20:29,966 --> 00:20:31,166
it's growing no

355
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,366
it's happy no

356
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:37,000
the color is so so that means if the color is good

357
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:41,200
and then you look it's bright and so you think oh

358
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,066
that one your your plant is grow very well

359
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:48,500
so so it will give you this this feeling like you know

360
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:54,266
people keep going up it's also same like a human we have a hope

361
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:56,100
we always have a hope yeah

362
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:59,333
uh like Donald Trump and he will say oh

363
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,800
make uh America great again yeah yeah

364
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,500
the optimism yeah yeah

365
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,300
so that's all all the the hope yeah and also had like um

366
00:21:10,133 --> 00:21:11,666
uh something like positive uh

367
00:21:12,066 --> 00:21:15,800
we had positive to doing things or positive to grow up

368
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,266
uh like your your uh

369
00:21:18,266 --> 00:21:22,700
everyone want your kids is positive not negative yeah yeah

370
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,133
of course

371
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:27,400
the negative that definitely will bring the problem for you

372
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,366
but if if the positive maybe

373
00:21:30,366 --> 00:21:34,333
they're more willing to help you doing things you know eh

374
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:34,866
eh you know

375
00:21:34,866 --> 00:21:36,800
make make you feel good yeah

376
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:39,400
so so that's the one so so

377
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,466
usually is the wood is is the element is like that

378
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,366
but also

379
00:21:44,366 --> 00:21:50,466
we need understand you know for wood we talk about spring so

380
00:21:50,533 --> 00:21:51,766
actually spring

381
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,500
you you feel is like a heart bit warm coming

382
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:59,366
but it still had a little bit chill of course

383
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,800
yeah yeah yeah so so in inside the bath

384
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,533
we also had temperature temperature means for example

385
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,166
uh your bath if you uh had lots of uh element you know

386
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:17,166
it's more uh connect with the spring wound so you

387
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,866
you looks a bit warm

388
00:22:18,866 --> 00:22:21,666
but actually had a little bit chill hmm

389
00:22:21,666 --> 00:22:24,266
it's better like for personality you know

390
00:22:24,366 --> 00:22:27,066
uh this person uh is a nice person

391
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:32,300
but sometimes maybe had a little bit chilly or little you know

392
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:33,533
yeah

393
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:38,466
so it was showing your outside yeah but also for the temperature

394
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,766
they also compact with the money for example you got this

395
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,166
element node

396
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:55,666
uh at the fall pala and uh if if it's a bit warm and towards hot

397
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,766
and usually

398
00:22:56,766 --> 00:23:01,200
we can say oh probably this person is quite rich you know

399
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,100
it is connect for the nature

400
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,500
because you know when we grow things usually

401
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,800
we grow at spring

402
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:10,800
but we will have lots of lots of results

403
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,300
or you know the the good stuff coming for example

404
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,000
you plan watermelon

405
00:23:17,066 --> 00:23:20,166
then at the summertime you got lots of watermelon coming

406
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:23,600
hmm so so that's why when the people's uh

407
00:23:23,733 --> 00:23:25,866
you know the the fall pala and they

408
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,866
they bit showing you a bit warm or hot

409
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:29,700
and actually

410
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:35,366
they were more close to uh rich but if you like winter time so

411
00:23:35,366 --> 00:23:41,733
it's too cold and you know it's frozen and too many cold

412
00:23:41,733 --> 00:23:45,733
nose warm and cheek maybe the life is bit

413
00:23:45,733 --> 00:23:50,266
a bit tough you know for for some some showing yeah yeah

414
00:23:50,366 --> 00:23:51,466
a traffic right no

415
00:23:51,466 --> 00:23:53,933
that's the that's the wood

416
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:58,333
then we go forward for the fire so fire yeah

417
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:02,200
i think everyone knows the fire yeah

418
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,533
fire yeah

419
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:06,133
because yeah yeah

420
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:07,600
when we talk about oh

421
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,000
some some some boy

422
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,533
the boy is hot right

423
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:18,200
so that means yeah i found another image in this fire huh yeah

424
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,133
yeah yeah

425
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:23,566
so like we will say when people angry so

426
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,933
so that means you inside your body

427
00:24:25,933 --> 00:24:27,866
the Chi and the fire you know

428
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,533
the gas click then

429
00:24:29,533 --> 00:24:32,933
then you start showing you know that your energy you know

430
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:36,933
you express out is a bit angry or something you know that

431
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,133
that's also uh

432
00:24:38,133 --> 00:24:39,866
it's it's the fire so

433
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:45,900
if we just imagine if both people have this this strong feeling

434
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:48,866
so they definitely will we had a big fighting

435
00:24:48,866 --> 00:24:50,000
yeah yeah

436
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,866
and do you know just yesterday and

437
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,066
our farm had one

438
00:24:57,366 --> 00:25:00,600
you know the person to move in for the conven

439
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:05,133
and he he told us the horrible story so

440
00:25:05,533 --> 00:25:09,200
before he moved to the Conway he lived in the Conway park

441
00:25:09,366 --> 00:25:13,333
you know that he lived in a you know the the camp

442
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:18,166
and and that night at the middle night

443
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:23,866
i think around two o'clock and a woman use a hammer to kill a

444
00:25:23,866 --> 00:25:25,333
man oh

445
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:30,466
yeah so so that must be extremely fair you know

446
00:25:30,466 --> 00:25:32,066
maybe the people drink alcohol

447
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:36,066
maybe they take drugs and so when they you know they

448
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:38,533
they couldn't control themselves

449
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:42,900
and then destroyed so it be the be the like the the fire

450
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,466
the power you know

451
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:48,366
that will have the uh sublimation of power you know

452
00:25:48,366 --> 00:25:49,800
the power goes up

453
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,166
and they maybe had glories and heat power you know

454
00:25:54,533 --> 00:25:58,933
um so but if if you know everything is goes over

455
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:02,700
and they will destroy something yeah so

456
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,300
so that's the story a very sad story

457
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,900
but it's also qualified story yeah so

458
00:26:09,166 --> 00:26:11,766
that can explain you know the people you know

459
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,300
too many fire

460
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:18,166
and that maybe that they were doing something unbelievable yeah

461
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,866
so every elements have a two side right fire of course

462
00:26:21,866 --> 00:26:28,566
means that enthusiasm but another side is can destroy right yeah

463
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:30,600
if you go to over the limit

464
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:35,333
you know when in Chinese philosophy

465
00:26:35,366 --> 00:26:39,300
so everything is not enough not enough still okay

466
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:43,200
because you still can go to reach another level

467
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:47,066
but if you over the over

468
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:48,133
once you're over

469
00:26:48,133 --> 00:26:50,166
you can't go back fail so

470
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:55,766
that's why we always talk about the balance of the element hmm

471
00:26:55,766 --> 00:26:58,766
because if once you're over the limit

472
00:26:58,866 --> 00:27:02,533
and that will step to the destroyer whatever

473
00:27:02,933 --> 00:27:07,400
any element so you can't be over

474
00:27:07,533 --> 00:27:08,966
so once you're over

475
00:27:09,066 --> 00:27:10,566
it's destroyed yeah

476
00:27:11,866 --> 00:27:13,500
that's very important okay

477
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:13,566
yeah yeah

478
00:27:13,566 --> 00:27:15,000
yeah so that's why

479
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,533
so oh because

480
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:22,133
the the summer uh not only had fire and fire also brings joy

481
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,800
joy hmm uh

482
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,066
so probably you will feel like you know some people uh

483
00:27:29,066 --> 00:27:31,400
born in summertime or something

484
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,300
and maybe

485
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:37,200
they are personality is more hurry up and more bit tough

486
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:40,100
and you know you will have a feeling of the joy

487
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,266
you know the the the the the feeling of that so hmm

488
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,333
um yeah that

489
00:27:46,333 --> 00:27:49,600
maybe there's something they a bit careless

490
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,500
just to rush or something so that that could be portable

491
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,100
you know it's it's

492
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,000
it's like you know

493
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,166
some people got too many fire in their you know the uh

494
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:04,333
what's called the the the bascalla

495
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:07,000
hmm yeah so that's um

496
00:28:07,366 --> 00:28:11,700
then we go to the next is for the earth soil yeah

497
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,266
that we can say soil

498
00:28:13,366 --> 00:28:17,300
some uh yeah because in the in the universe

499
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,133
the the biggest

500
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:24,600
soil is earth so hmm so we usually will say when we say soil

501
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,800
we'll talk about the earth but also

502
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,300
the for the soil actually

503
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:36,133
they had um for they they they carry off the the change season

504
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,600
uh for example uh

505
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,000
if the winter soil when the soil

506
00:28:43,366 --> 00:28:46,733
uh looks when you touch maybe you feel it's cold

507
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:52,666
but actually inside the soil is a bit warm you know they is bit

508
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:57,133
like some person you know they looks like they bit cool

509
00:28:57,166 --> 00:29:02,600
or they they not really you know uh you know um for example

510
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:05,733
they had uh personality is uh

511
00:29:06,366 --> 00:29:06,900
little bit

512
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,066
cooling or something

513
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,466
but you you

514
00:29:09,466 --> 00:29:13,533
when you go with them and you will find they had a little bit

515
00:29:13,766 --> 00:29:18,533
you know comfortable heart in a way you mean ah

516
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,466
you remind me that for example

517
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:23,800
a stable stable guy yeah a

518
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:31,266
uh maybe you you can find something some softer area

519
00:29:31,266 --> 00:29:32,466
right inside right

520
00:29:32,533 --> 00:29:33,566
do you mean that

521
00:29:33,866 --> 00:29:34,800
yeah yeah yeah

522
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,200
something you may be uh

523
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:40,333
you feeling these people is lonely or fooling

524
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:44,500
and you know i had one feeling when i was doing my job

525
00:29:44,766 --> 00:29:48,866
and i had one homeless guest

526
00:29:49,166 --> 00:29:50,766
because the government

527
00:29:50,866 --> 00:29:53,366
Australian government actually very good

528
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:56,600
so they look after the the homeless person

529
00:29:56,966 --> 00:29:59,900
so they give them accommodation you know they

530
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,200
they can live

531
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,000
and

532
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,333
so they also provide you know the people like me to take them

533
00:30:07,333 --> 00:30:09,600
to some place to do the exercise

534
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,100
for example go to the swimming pool

535
00:30:12,133 --> 00:30:13,866
so they had some trainer

536
00:30:13,866 --> 00:30:14,533
they know that

537
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:18,733
they training them to doing some swimming exercise yeah

538
00:30:18,866 --> 00:30:24,366
so my job is just pick up them and drop them home so that day

539
00:30:24,466 --> 00:30:28,500
um he he did the training for the swimming so after that

540
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,866
he asked me says oh

541
00:30:29,866 --> 00:30:34,566
can we stop at one of my five coffee shop

542
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:39,700
very close to my house and he want to buy something to eat yeah

543
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,733
so when we go to the shops and and he said oh

544
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,300
he looks a bit happy because usually he give me the

545
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:54,366
feeling is very cooling or you know the distance right

546
00:30:54,366 --> 00:30:57,300
i said yes and distance with you or something yeah

547
00:30:57,466 --> 00:31:00,766
but that day he looks a bit happy

548
00:31:00,766 --> 00:31:05,766
and look looks so comfortable just feeling comfortable

549
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,266
and then he said okay

550
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:08,966
can i buy a coffee for you

551
00:31:09,266 --> 00:31:11,000
so i think okay

552
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:15,266
so he bought a coffee for me with a very you know

553
00:31:15,266 --> 00:31:17,466
the sexful feeling or something you know

554
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:21,533
like a very good warm or comfortable feeling so

555
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,966
so i still remember he give me handle me

556
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:26,700
the coffee and he sits there

557
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,200
and he's eat something and drink something

558
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,733
and his face you know

559
00:31:30,733 --> 00:31:31,966
explores some

560
00:31:31,966 --> 00:31:34,600
some some bit warm bright you know

561
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,400
there at that time i feel my heart is bit touched you know um

562
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,333
yeah that imaging is always you know understand yeah yeah

563
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:47,000
yeah so i just think like you know

564
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,300
even the people had the difficult life or something

565
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:54,166
and they also still have some you know feeling you know

566
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,266
that that you couldn't you know

567
00:31:56,266 --> 00:31:58,100
forget and yeah

568
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,766
it's from the scripture

569
00:31:59,766 --> 00:32:01,066
but it

570
00:32:01,066 --> 00:32:04,866
it can explain you know that the soil that has different stage

571
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:07,866
and that has you know the different condition

572
00:32:07,866 --> 00:32:12,666
so that's why we called when we had well underground water

573
00:32:13,466 --> 00:32:16,066
actually winter time you get the water

574
00:32:16,066 --> 00:32:18,066
that water is warm it

575
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:21,966
because the the surface of the earth is cold

576
00:32:21,966 --> 00:32:25,900
but the inside of the you know the deepest soil

577
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:27,666
it still had a big

578
00:32:27,666 --> 00:32:28,933
temperature yeah

579
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:29,766
hmm so so

580
00:32:29,766 --> 00:32:36,200
that's just a get an example to mansion so the the the soil

581
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,266
actually that had a different season you know

582
00:32:39,266 --> 00:32:41,866
that that carry on the change season yeah

583
00:32:41,966 --> 00:32:43,800
got it okay yeah

584
00:32:43,933 --> 00:32:46,766
then we go to the mantle water yeah

585
00:32:46,766 --> 00:32:47,800
oh mando yeah

586
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
you always say gold yeah

587
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:56,266
hmm but um you say gold is is is also correct

588
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,200
is because when we talk about in gold

589
00:32:59,366 --> 00:33:02,700
and most people will connect with gold in in

590
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:06,300
mental the mental uh

591
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,133
every element we separate in young so

592
00:33:09,266 --> 00:33:11,566
hmm for wood we will say young

593
00:33:11,566 --> 00:33:14,766
wood or in Wu then hmm for the mental also

594
00:33:14,766 --> 00:33:16,300
we had young mental

595
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,900
or in mental so

596
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,066
the in mental is actually is like the gold you know

597
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:24,533
the hmm is bright

598
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,766
yellow or golden you know

599
00:33:26,766 --> 00:33:29,066
and it's soft you know usually

600
00:33:29,066 --> 00:33:32,666
they cover on the a lot of things outside you know

601
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:35,466
the surface or the booty you know

602
00:33:35,466 --> 00:33:37,800
they cover with the gold outside

603
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,866
or something so so

604
00:33:39,866 --> 00:33:41,666
that's that's so

605
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:47,666
the gold is actually is belong to the one major you know

606
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:49,766
the the mental you know

607
00:33:49,766 --> 00:33:52,733
hmm in this farm element mental yeah

608
00:33:53,166 --> 00:33:55,066
hmm yeah so so

609
00:33:55,066 --> 00:34:01,333
it's also connect with like autumn uh west side and also

610
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,300
it's hard bitter you know like uh

611
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,400
con converging you know

612
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,733
it's bitter like a convergion to get in so so for example

613
00:34:10,733 --> 00:34:14,733
the personality maybe you you can feel you know

614
00:34:14,766 --> 00:34:15,800
some people had a

615
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,000
very strong personality

616
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:20,900
but you can feel that the heartbeat

617
00:34:21,066 --> 00:34:24,566
um convenging note for when they do things

618
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:27,166
or talking things or something yeah

619
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:29,700
so they have their own area you know

620
00:34:29,966 --> 00:34:35,733
this is my my opinion you know it's it's very strong feeling so

621
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:37,266
if you understand

622
00:34:37,266 --> 00:34:41,766
you can feel like something like that so but also

623
00:34:41,766 --> 00:34:44,133
if extremely you know

624
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:48,666
they also had a cool of killing you know the the it

625
00:34:48,666 --> 00:34:51,966
it's like you use the the weapon

626
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,300
you know the weapon yeah to to killing something no hmm

627
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,900
it's also the uh connect with the the mental yeah no

628
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:06,333
that's definitely is the is it in mental right or young mental

629
00:35:07,133 --> 00:35:12,666
um in mental is uh like you know um

630
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,666
some some special year

631
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,200
and then they had a special month you know they had if they had

632
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:24,166
they had too many in mental um when i talk with my friend

633
00:35:24,166 --> 00:35:26,166
or something and maybe

634
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,866
she was said i don't know what happened but today

635
00:35:29,866 --> 00:35:32,000
i just feeling a little bit sad

636
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,600
you know is this feeling like yeah yeah yeah

637
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,700
you don't know what reason

638
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:40,766
you just feeling like a little bit sad you know so so

639
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:44,666
the inventor is give you a little bit of feeling

640
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:48,133
but not strong not shocking you yes

641
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:51,600
it's just a little bit eh but the young mental is they

642
00:35:51,766 --> 00:35:56,366
they're going too strong if you will feel big hurt you

643
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,466
you you'll be heard by some you know

644
00:36:01,966 --> 00:36:04,166
whatever some people's words

645
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:07,066
or if the people's words is very sharp

646
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,933
hmm i just for example for example

647
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,066
when mom you know

648
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:17,533
and she look after kids

649
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:22,133
and the kids is not happy to eat the meal

650
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:24,700
or or every time you know uh

651
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,333
can't you know eat meal

652
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,166
you know the or finish

653
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:29,100
well yeah

654
00:36:29,366 --> 00:36:31,666
then the mom very angry no

655
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:32,600
that was them no

656
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,266
no no you know it's a bit like you know like autumn you know

657
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:41,166
suddenly the temperature is change is cooling yeah

658
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:44,666
hmm then you can feel the the the change

659
00:36:44,966 --> 00:36:48,733
then you just it's bit like you know someone to hammer you

660
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:51,066
that is that big feeling so

661
00:36:51,066 --> 00:36:53,000
so people will be you know

662
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,733
the kids definitely will be scared yeah

663
00:36:55,866 --> 00:36:58,700
then we can say punish actually

664
00:36:58,700 --> 00:37:03,266
the punish this word is more connect with the mental

665
00:37:03,333 --> 00:37:05,166
so you gotta punish

666
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,766
because you didn't finish your meal

667
00:37:07,766 --> 00:37:11,900
so you have to go outside and stand at the outside the door

668
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,666
and for maybe five minutes or ten minutes or half an hour yeah

669
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:21,600
hahaha we we we often see that kind of story yeah so

670
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,966
so that power uh

671
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:27,700
most of time is belong to the mental power uh

672
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,000
huh yeah so

673
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,400
so for for people

674
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:31,733
maybe they're doing strongly

675
00:37:31,733 --> 00:37:34,933
you can feel so strong and maybe they

676
00:37:35,333 --> 00:37:40,900
they are born in the day is the young mental day oh

677
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,200
yeah so okay

678
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:45,700
so the personality is very interesting so you you

679
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,666
you can check your future

680
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:51,166
if you feeling like yeah something like that

681
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,166
and because i

682
00:37:52,166 --> 00:37:56,500
i did have experience for some some friends

683
00:37:56,533 --> 00:37:58,266
you know that they are young

684
00:37:58,266 --> 00:37:59,133
mental yeah

685
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:01,366
oh really yeah

686
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,000
so i i really understand that yeah

687
00:38:05,266 --> 00:38:08,566
so that's a mental maybe one day you can

688
00:38:08,566 --> 00:38:12,000
you can just uh try to help us to deep dive

689
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:18,533
understand about the the this five elements as in Yang

690
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,466
because i yeah yeah yeah

691
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:21,700
yeah yeah

692
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,766
we we will go through with like uh each heavenly system and so

693
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:33,766
so we can know you know the the each each element and what's in

694
00:38:33,766 --> 00:38:37,966
what's young what which person is connect with this one

695
00:38:37,966 --> 00:38:41,933
so we can have good example to talk about that yeah

696
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:45,066
yeah to fully understand yeah yeah yeah

697
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:47,200
so the last one is uh

698
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:49,800
we we talk about the element is the water

699
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,900
so i think water is we don't need that without water

700
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,400
no one can survive

701
00:38:56,966 --> 00:38:58,533
of course okay

702
00:38:58,866 --> 00:39:04,166
so water is a very big element you know the essential yeah yeah

703
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,966
essential elephant so for the water

704
00:39:07,166 --> 00:39:12,066
water had the personality is like they were running down

705
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,266
you know you know

706
00:39:13,266 --> 00:39:14,733
water can running down

707
00:39:14,733 --> 00:39:15,900
even deep deep

708
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,600
deep under the earth

709
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,866
so that's why someplace we can hide the wheel

710
00:39:21,866 --> 00:39:26,766
and if you check the Australian map for underground water

711
00:39:26,966 --> 00:39:28,133
and you can see

712
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:35,500
the big map of the area of the Australian underground water so

713
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:36,400
yeah so

714
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,600
that's that's

715
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:42,000
the water had for but for example is big maybe

716
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:45,700
uh you know the people with the water uh

717
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,533
uh you know the element

718
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:53,500
and uh maybe they will go go down to check like you know

719
00:39:54,566 --> 00:39:56,266
uh the story could be

720
00:39:56,266 --> 00:40:01,066
and this person is is from the the family is very very

721
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:04,866
you know the the basic family for the uh yes

722
00:40:04,866 --> 00:40:06,600
for the country you know they

723
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,466
they very not good condition or something i

724
00:40:11,466 --> 00:40:17,300
i can explain for like my mom because my mom is water and and

725
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,733
when when she's born that time is

726
00:40:20,533 --> 00:40:23,166
um yeah it's after Japanese war

727
00:40:23,566 --> 00:40:25,666
um and also

728
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:30,366
yeah it's that time the people's health is not really good

729
00:40:30,366 --> 00:40:34,566
and Medicare system is not good so um

730
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:39,666
that time women had maybe seven or eight children you know so

731
00:40:39,866 --> 00:40:43,966
when when she family yeah when she's only two years old

732
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:47,566
her mommy is because he had the the ninth

733
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,966
you know child and then

734
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,333
and when when she give birth to the child

735
00:40:53,333 --> 00:40:55,300
that had a problem so

736
00:40:55,666 --> 00:41:00,366
so she died with the the nice children so hmm

737
00:41:00,366 --> 00:41:01,000
so so

738
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:04,133
my mom is two years old she lost her mom

739
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:08,900
and then four years old because the father catch a cold

740
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,766
you know you know

741
00:41:09,766 --> 00:41:13,600
we we will say the cover before so uh

742
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,733
it's like you know people

743
00:41:14,733 --> 00:41:18,366
catch a cold and you could be died or something they of course

744
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:19,666
lose their lives yeah yeah

745
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:20,866
actually it's in

746
00:41:20,866 --> 00:41:23,933
the the the long time ago it happened so

747
00:41:23,933 --> 00:41:24,966
that's why so

748
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,933
my mom's father is uh also

749
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:34,100
i call my grandfather is died when he uh catch a cold

750
00:41:34,333 --> 00:41:38,966
and then because the family condition that time is too poor

751
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:43,900
so they don't want to pay the money to buy some medicine so

752
00:41:43,966 --> 00:41:48,600
and they didn't realize it's very serious situation so

753
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,500
that's why he loses life so

754
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,100
so that's why

755
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,266
my mom is is a little water

756
00:41:54,366 --> 00:41:56,733
and he is in a very low position

757
00:41:56,733 --> 00:42:00,366
she know like no uh grow up with no father

758
00:42:00,366 --> 00:42:04,366
no mother but he's strongly you know like powerfully

759
00:42:04,366 --> 00:42:08,533
you know to to to grow by herself yeah

760
00:42:08,533 --> 00:42:09,133
so that's why

761
00:42:09,133 --> 00:42:11,733
even now my mom is over eighty

762
00:42:11,733 --> 00:42:14,866
and she's still you know working hard

763
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,700
you know doing things never stop yeah

764
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:18,533
so so

765
00:42:18,533 --> 00:42:23,500
that's the water water is really powerful for oh yeah

766
00:42:23,766 --> 00:42:27,200
the the water life yeah you know Fred when when you

767
00:42:27,266 --> 00:42:29,266
when you talk about

768
00:42:29,266 --> 00:42:33,533
the water means keeping running down i at that time

769
00:42:33,533 --> 00:42:36,600
i thought oh that means people uh

770
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,866
be willing not to fight for but actually

771
00:42:40,866 --> 00:42:42,700
it's it's totally wrong

772
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:47,300
right water can also stand for the strong huh yeah yeah

773
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:51,366
yeah water can stand in the very poor condition

774
00:42:51,366 --> 00:42:57,133
but still strongly to grow up because survive right yeah survive

775
00:42:57,133 --> 00:42:58,300
because the water harder

776
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:01,366
the the things is that they can run it down

777
00:43:01,466 --> 00:43:03,366
but when condition change

778
00:43:03,366 --> 00:43:04,933
because you you can see in

779
00:43:04,933 --> 00:43:08,766
the universe the water is always you know up down up

780
00:43:08,766 --> 00:43:09,400
down you know

781
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,700
when heat come

782
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,766
the water goes up

783
00:43:12,766 --> 00:43:13,666
steam you know

784
00:43:13,666 --> 00:43:16,200
it's it's something like that so so

785
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,766
when my mom is when she's young

786
00:43:18,766 --> 00:43:20,600
maybe she had a very poor condition

787
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,533
but when she go to the stage of the fire

788
00:43:23,666 --> 00:43:26,933
and she she moving from the the poor place

789
00:43:26,933 --> 00:43:29,366
and to the big city so so

790
00:43:29,366 --> 00:43:31,800
that's the condition change maybe for some people

791
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,933
is they step on there you know the position

792
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,666
and and straight away go to the very high position

793
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,933
and and the future

794
00:43:40,933 --> 00:43:47,100
we will explain the the person like um a Robert candy yeah

795
00:43:47,133 --> 00:43:51,066
and he is the the the what person as well so so

796
00:43:51,066 --> 00:43:52,700
when we talk about yeah

797
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:57,466
the the heavenly stamp and we can yeah to to explain you know

798
00:43:57,566 --> 00:44:00,666
know the the more about that so so

799
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:05,200
we know the the water that had lots of uh things that can change

800
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,100
so that's why for personality

801
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:12,100
water is is a person they usually like to change so

802
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,200
if you talk with the uh water person

803
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,400
maybe she or he was said oh uh

804
00:44:17,866 --> 00:44:20,566
i like to to change something oh

805
00:44:20,566 --> 00:44:22,266
i want my life to be changed

806
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:23,533
you know you know

807
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,333
they will have the the the thinking or idea

808
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:27,266
they want to change it

809
00:44:27,266 --> 00:44:29,200
you know they don't want to stay in the same

810
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:32,300
same situation or something so so

811
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,366
that's the world we

812
00:44:33,366 --> 00:44:35,400
can you know check you know for the water

813
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,500
because we need to know the water will change their shape

814
00:44:39,566 --> 00:44:42,166
you know they were running down the they

815
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:47,266
they can hide underground they also can steam in the sky so so

816
00:44:47,266 --> 00:44:48,100
that's why so

817
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:51,333
water's life is actually is quite

818
00:44:51,333 --> 00:44:53,966
interesting yeah interest

819
00:44:53,966 --> 00:44:56,100
not just understand yourself

820
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,500
but also understand the people surround

821
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:03,333
you can help the people keep a good relationship right

822
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:07,666
so help me to make a good day at least

823
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:17,200
so and after the the five elements uh

824
00:45:17,666 --> 00:45:20,700
which concept do you think we still need to learn

825
00:45:20,966 --> 00:45:25,866
if people our um audience want to know what type

826
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:28,300
of their uh personality like

827
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:33,166
just you said uh somebody is uh as water type somebody is uh

828
00:45:33,466 --> 00:45:34,800
the Wu type right

829
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:40,600
we want to know ourselves with more details uh yes yes

830
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,500
so that's why we have to know so what is heavily uh

831
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:50,666
the same so for heavenly stem and um and um

832
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:51,066
i think

833
00:45:51,066 --> 00:45:56,300
the audience can follow us to you know to read these ten first

834
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,200
so um the heavenly stem is uh

835
00:46:00,366 --> 00:46:11,000
甲乙丙丁悟己庚辛人鬼

836
00:46:11,533 --> 00:46:13,733
so i explain a little bit so

837
00:46:13,733 --> 00:46:16,266
the Jah ja means

838
00:46:16,266 --> 00:46:17,300
Yang Wu

839
00:46:18,266 --> 00:46:22,533

Ying fire Wu means

842
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,700

鬼名in ward so so

846
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,300
that's the ten element actually

847
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:52,800
we can you know to explain one by one today

848
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:58,200
so we can use like the example of the person oh

849
00:46:58,366 --> 00:47:04,866
yeah okay yeah so for before we start so we can

850
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:12,266
have look you know the i made some picture you know first

851
00:47:12,266 --> 00:47:18,266
we talk about the first one we call ja so so what

852
00:47:18,266 --> 00:47:19,733
what what do you think

853
00:47:19,933 --> 00:47:22,366
the the jay do you know the carry

854
00:47:22,366 --> 00:47:24,966
you know anything about that you

855
00:47:24,966 --> 00:47:27,866
mean Jah just Jah yeah

856
00:47:30,533 --> 00:47:31,466
no idea

857
00:47:32,566 --> 00:47:34,333
hahaha idea no idea

858
00:47:34,666 --> 00:47:37,366
jam is a young wood

859
00:47:37,366 --> 00:47:38,366
right young wood

860
00:47:38,366 --> 00:47:40,800
yeah okay young wood

861
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,066
wood means the first image is means

862
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:47,466
um

863
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,366
i ll say that

864
00:47:54,100 --> 00:48:01,933
uh of course wood means the hope uh we just talk about it and uh

865
00:48:05,533 --> 00:48:07,300
and how do i say that

866
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:12,366
but also i think wood is hmm that means

867
00:48:15,166 --> 00:48:20,600
not very sharp you know the people not very sharp just uh

868
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:30,066
can just be a good listener so uh huh but i

869
00:48:31,666 --> 00:48:35,800
can't figure out the difference between the young wood

870
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:41,200
and in wood so all the thing i can say is just about wood

871
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:44,266
yeah so for for talking that

872
00:48:44,266 --> 00:48:49,166
i think we use the famous person to explain uh should be uh

873
00:48:49,166 --> 00:48:51,733
more easy actually

874
00:48:51,733 --> 00:48:58,733
the the people had you know the the we call the the fat

875
00:48:58,733 --> 00:49:04,566
owner is jar and it's anal mask so um

876
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:08,000
i think every mask everyone know know him

877
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:12,400
because he is owner of the twitter and now we call

878
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:17,533
the x yeah so so the the jar um also uh

879
00:49:17,533 --> 00:49:19,000
it's bit like um

880
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,266
we we can't say the the the jar is exactly the wood

881
00:49:23,466 --> 00:49:26,733
it's bit like the seed you know you know

882
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:28,800
like when we have seed

883
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,900
maybe this seed is tomato

884
00:49:31,066 --> 00:49:32,766
maybe this seed is chili

885
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:38,300
maybe this seed is is a big tree when when we grow up

886
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:39,700
you know so so

887
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:41,800
we don't know what seed is

888
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:44,700
because you don't know the people grow up

889
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,533
the what environment and what parents they are

890
00:49:48,533 --> 00:49:52,400
and what beseeting in them like hmm

891
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:59,400
like some i remember is to American president and Obama is

892
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,566
that i have a dream yeah

893
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,933
so it seemed like that i have a dream

894
00:50:04,933 --> 00:50:07,133
so what's the Elon Musk dream

895
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:12,866
Elon Musk want to move people to the to the called Tomas

896
00:50:12,966 --> 00:50:14,066
Tomas yeah

897
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,100
so that that he

898
00:50:17,466 --> 00:50:18,266
he always

899
00:50:18,266 --> 00:50:22,900
he said he he like to know uh change something or something

900
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,733
but he also said like uh he had a period of time

901
00:50:28,266 --> 00:50:33,400
and he feel like uh often better pressure

902
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,566
or disgrace of funding

903
00:50:35,933 --> 00:50:38,100
and uh i can understand

904
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:42,300
because you just think in the universe the world and actually

905
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,066
the wood when you grow

906
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:48,066
you take a long time because it's from spring to winter

907
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:52,000
and you have to face all different challenges for example

908
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,200
today maybe had water or tomorrow maybe too dry

909
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,566
maybe today sun come too hot

910
00:50:57,566 --> 00:51:00,866
maybe maybe the today is no sun at all i

911
00:51:00,866 --> 00:51:03,066
hope i had the sun or something so

912
00:51:03,066 --> 00:51:05,400
that's why the for the wood person

913
00:51:05,533 --> 00:51:10,200
the the personality is very sensitive you know

914
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,100
it's very sensitive with outside environment

915
00:51:14,133 --> 00:51:17,366
or you know the things change or something so

916
00:51:17,366 --> 00:51:23,600
they have to learning like how to you know face the change so so

917
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:27,600
we can see from the Elon mask story you know actually

918
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:31,733
he faced lots of you know difficult challenge

919
00:51:31,733 --> 00:51:35,466
difficult situations or money gone you know

920
00:51:35,466 --> 00:51:40,266
things cannot continue and so but for Elon Musk

921
00:51:40,266 --> 00:51:41,700
he had a very famous uh

922
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,666
uh word instead

923
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:50,366
uh play to win or don't play at all so um

924
00:51:50,366 --> 00:51:53,000
hmm that that sentence is actually

925
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:59,300
is really much for the uh the the you know jamu and yeah jamu

926
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:01,333
we called young wood yeah

927
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:03,366
because uh

928
00:52:03,366 --> 00:52:08,100
because the wood is want doing something and success so so

929
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,766
like if if you you

930
00:52:09,866 --> 00:52:12,800
you just are uh uh like

931
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:15,966
i said it's a melon or watermelon yeah

932
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,666
you want to be grown up

933
00:52:17,666 --> 00:52:21,133
and then you can start to have the melon

934
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,800
then you can grow up become a big melon

935
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,200
then people happily to eat yeah

936
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,333
so so that's why

937
00:52:28,333 --> 00:52:29,800
so for a young wood

938
00:52:29,866 --> 00:52:34,600
there is a seeding and this seed is will become future

939
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,533
become a success you know

940
00:52:36,533 --> 00:52:40,600
a result to to showing people you know so so

941
00:52:40,766 --> 00:52:41,933
that's why so

942
00:52:42,366 --> 00:52:48,200
we use the aloe mask to explain the Jah so people can uh

943
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:51,600
more easy to understand so what's

944
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:55,866
the Jah yeah so then we talk about

945
00:52:57,166 --> 00:52:59,566
d the second uh i love uh

946
00:52:59,566 --> 00:53:06,366
you know the heavenly system so so we use the person um

947
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,300
the uh is um

948
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:18,333

950
00:53:26,166 --> 00:53:29,100
yeah the Clinton actually

951
00:53:29,266 --> 00:53:36,466
he is in in wood so in wood is bit like no

952
00:53:36,466 --> 00:53:38,600
the the uh we call young

953
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,000
young wood is is not actually

954
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,666
the the the thing you know the the plan it is

955
00:53:44,900 --> 00:53:48,700
but in wood is actually plan for example

956
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,366
the in wood this one is

957
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:52,400
the sunflower

958
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:56,266
or this one is ah know that they're already showing you

959
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:58,200
you know that they they

960
00:53:58,366 --> 00:53:59,966
they are you know the some

961
00:53:59,966 --> 00:54:02,000
some kind of thing so hmm

962
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,100
so they will have like uh something that

963
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:07,766
like or don't like you know

964
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:09,533
they will obviously to showing you

965
00:54:09,533 --> 00:54:14,666
you know uh also you know when when you go to the the universe

966
00:54:14,666 --> 00:54:16,400
you know the the plans or things

967
00:54:16,700 --> 00:54:20,100
and they were uh full of empathy something

968
00:54:20,166 --> 00:54:25,300
so so they their personality will be a bit softer you know

969
00:54:25,466 --> 00:54:27,500
you know that you just think the tree you know

970
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,333
they were waving you know hmm had a bit of softer um

971
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:32,766
personality uh

972
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:37,933
but they had strong power inside because you just think you

973
00:54:37,933 --> 00:54:38,900
you are planned

974
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:42,166
you have to have strong power to inside than you can hold you

975
00:54:42,166 --> 00:54:45,966
know the shape of that yeah so so so

976
00:54:45,966 --> 00:54:46,500
that's why

977
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:51,200
so people may be showing outside that had some they are no

978
00:54:51,266 --> 00:54:53,266
um kind of you know the

979
00:54:53,266 --> 00:54:55,366
yeah yeah yeah

980
00:54:55,366 --> 00:54:58,900
cause everybody knows uh was uh mister

981
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:02,700
Clinton and it's very charming man right

982
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:03,733
yeah yeah yeah

983
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,166
that's right yeah yeah yeah

984
00:55:05,166 --> 00:55:09,100
that's why they had the the the love story you know yeah

985
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:10,900
because he just think the the

986
00:55:10,966 --> 00:55:13,133
maybe he is a flower you know or something

987
00:55:13,133 --> 00:55:16,266
that says got a love story yeah so hahaha yeah

988
00:55:17,566 --> 00:55:22,400
but but for him he said the he said say today

989
00:55:22,933 --> 00:55:28,566
uh future uh belongs to freedom uh not to fear so so

990
00:55:28,566 --> 00:55:30,733
for the the inward actually

991
00:55:30,966 --> 00:55:34,933
they like freedom because uh had freedom

992
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:36,400
so they can grow

993
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:40,966
they can flow some you know they can become something you know

994
00:55:40,966 --> 00:55:45,533
they can showing people the the the best part or something so

995
00:55:45,533 --> 00:55:50,333
that's why the the the inward you know they will yeah yeah

996
00:55:50,333 --> 00:55:52,866
totally different type yeah yeah yeah

997
00:55:52,866 --> 00:55:55,533
it's it's a different type of that

998
00:55:55,600 --> 00:56:01,300
but they will show you more soft part you know for something

999
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,100

00:57:01,766 --> 00:57:03,100
hmm more than the Trump

because American president and putting had a very good time

1020
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:10,400
and you know in a all

1021
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,900
the Chinese medium you know

1024
00:57:22,566 --> 00:57:23,266
yeah

1025
00:57:23,266 --> 00:57:29,066
i think it's a it's a is a is a major of the alpha man actually

1026
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:32,500
the the was that people said

1027
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,733
Elon Musk is alpha man right

1028
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:39,133
some some media said that before

1029
00:57:39,166 --> 00:57:41,133
but actually when you talk

1030
00:57:41,133 --> 00:57:46,533
a putting is for for for image he is already there right

1031
00:57:46,533 --> 00:57:48,533
he is alpha man yeah

1032
00:57:48,766 --> 00:57:50,000
he he won't be

1033
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:55,300
but he had a problem is he is a fat fat

1034
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:59,700
owner of the young the beam the the fire

1035
00:57:59,733 --> 00:58:04,066
but he had the the we called the garden you know

1036
00:58:04,066 --> 00:58:06,100
the the garden soil

1037
00:58:06,100 --> 00:58:08,766
on the the heavenly stem

1038
00:58:08,766 --> 00:58:11,066
so it's bit like you are sun

1039
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:16,133
but but they had a cloud to to block you hahaha

1040
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:20,666
hmm so so so that's why he he tried to be you know um

1041
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:22,900
you know the the the bit famous or

1042
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,166
something and always has something to block him

1043
00:58:27,066 --> 00:58:27,733
hmm so so

1044
00:58:27,733 --> 00:58:31,600
that's why he he can't be shining all the time yeah

1045
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:33,866
he won't be shining shining you know

1046
00:58:34,166 --> 00:58:35,700
hmm the world you know you know

1047
00:58:36,566 --> 00:58:38,766
like may or something or you know

1048
00:58:38,766 --> 00:58:40,133
i had power you know

1049
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:41,733
i had strong hot power

1050
00:58:42,566 --> 00:58:47,866
but the thing is because he had a cloud on the coverly color so

1051
00:58:47,866 --> 00:58:52,966
that's that means his son is a bit cloud to cover so

1052
00:58:53,066 --> 00:58:56,500
that's why he can't be shining you know a lot

1053
00:58:56,600 --> 00:59:02,800
so only special special time and it could be happened yeah yeah

1054
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:07,066
interesting so that's why pudding had

1055
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:09,366
the talk is say

1056
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:17,533
say not let the sun look down and say iglorious here

1057
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,800
he lies yeah

1058
00:59:20,866 --> 00:59:24,766
so it's bit like you know because the sun is a little bit high

1059
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,566
yeah so so

1060
00:59:26,566 --> 00:59:27,533
so that's why

1061
00:59:27,533 --> 00:59:29,866
he when he talk this

1062
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,700
i i think that that sentence is more bit

1063
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:36,066
much you know and heat element

1064
00:59:36,533 --> 00:59:39,200
hmm so so i use this one yeah

1065
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,133
hmm that's good ah yeah

1066
00:59:41,133 --> 00:59:43,766
so then we move to the next one

1067
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:47,966
we call the the the fourth uh heavenly system

1068
00:59:47,966 --> 00:59:49,300
it's called the thing

1069
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:52,300
hm it means in fire

1070
00:59:52,933 --> 00:59:55,133
so the in fire is more

1071
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:58,100
like a candle fire you know

1072
00:59:58,100 --> 01:00:03,466
the the the candle fire is more or little and weak right torch

1073
01:00:03,466 --> 01:00:04,300
fire you know

1074
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:07,300
the torch yeah torch light you know

1075
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:13,133
the that the in in fire is a very small shining

1076
01:00:13,133 --> 01:00:17,466
you know the the the the light something something like that

1077
01:00:17,933 --> 01:00:22,166
so so the the story for uh for this person uh

1078
01:00:22,933 --> 01:00:26,900
from the the ukin and uh uh

1079
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,366

1081
01:00:39,866 --> 01:00:41,266
哎咱可以先查一下

1082
01:00:41,266 --> 01:00:43,933
然后先查一下嗯

1083
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:46,533
okay so so

1084
01:00:46,533 --> 01:00:51,700
he is the person is is in fire hmm

1085
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,000
so we can see you know

1086
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:58,900
when when the Russia had the war with Ukraine

1087
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,200
and actually he used his mind you know

1088
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:05,333

01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:06,466
the people thinking you know

1090
01:01:06,466 --> 01:01:09,133
for example some people had a lot of idea

1091
01:01:09,966 --> 01:01:14,866
and they can you know this idea and make it working

1092
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:20,466
you know we we can see him to coming here coming there say this

1093
01:01:20,466 --> 01:01:23,533
say that and his idea is making you know

1094
01:01:23,533 --> 01:01:26,700
the the the the the the lots of country

1095
01:01:26,700 --> 01:01:29,766
or things to help him to protect

1096
01:01:29,933 --> 01:01:31,766
you know the the Ukraine

1097
01:01:31,766 --> 01:01:36,400
you know to help him to protect his country or something yeah

1098
01:01:36,866 --> 01:01:39,500
just a small flame huh yeah small flame

1099
01:01:39,500 --> 01:01:40,400
yeah it's like flame

1100
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:45,466
and he will come in maybe a once then second and then no

1101
01:01:45,466 --> 01:01:48,100
it's hahaha continually

1102
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:49,500
no continually

1103
01:01:49,533 --> 01:01:52,333
yeah i think is that already happened four years

1104
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:56,166
or or three years at least four years

1105
01:01:56,166 --> 01:01:57,733
i think yeah i think yes

1106
01:01:57,733 --> 01:02:01,300
four years already so the war you know you know so so

1107
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:05,133
he's becoming out of this shine the one second

1108
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:09,733
you know it's continually you know uh hmm yeah for his so so

1109
01:02:09,733 --> 01:02:17,400
he says he said life will conquer death

1110
01:02:17,966 --> 01:02:25,133
light will conquer darkness glory to Ukraine so so this

1111
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:31,133
this talking for him is actually quite much the the infile

1112
01:02:31,266 --> 01:02:33,700
because you just use the light

1113
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:38,866
you know to to conclude the the darkness yeah hmm

1114
01:02:40,466 --> 01:02:42,066
interesting yeah so

1115
01:02:42,066 --> 01:02:43,600
that's interesting yeah so

1116
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:44,533
that's that's what

1117
01:02:44,533 --> 01:02:50,366
i think so he is yeah with the like that yeah so so

1118
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:55,600
that's why so the in in fire is is the fire is a bit small

1119
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:56,800
a little light

1120
01:02:57,166 --> 01:02:58,566
and it's not uh

1121
01:02:59,066 --> 01:03:03,066
not a hundred percent sure and you know sometimes come

1122
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,900
sometimes um yeah

1123
01:03:04,900 --> 01:03:09,766
it's it's hard or something so so sometimes maybe very quiet

1124
01:03:09,766 --> 01:03:13,166
sometimes you know come out you know the so they they

1125
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:17,866
they are the move movement is you know um yes

1126
01:03:18,066 --> 01:03:19,966
it's better like that yeah

1127
01:03:20,933 --> 01:03:21,466
uh huh so

1128
01:03:21,466 --> 01:03:24,933
then we move forward to the the fifth

1129
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:29,400
to the we go to the middle to the fifth of heavenly

1130
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:36,866
then so we call the the Wu to Wu to means the um the young soil

1131
01:03:37,266 --> 01:03:39,000
young soil yeah so

1132
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,766
the young soil yeah so

1133
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:47,666
the young soil and uh at at the moment think is uh

1134
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:53,000
you know the the Donald Trump choose the uh vice

1135
01:03:53,066 --> 01:03:58,300
uh president hmm shady ones yeah yes

1136
01:03:58,300 --> 01:04:00,066
Benz yeah so so

1137
01:04:00,066 --> 01:04:01,133
Benz actually

1138
01:04:01,133 --> 01:04:07,600
he is the the the young soil yeah so so uh

1139
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:11,600
i think he he decide uh when he's had speech

1140
01:04:11,600 --> 01:04:16,900
he always talk about his homeland yeah so

1141
01:04:16,966 --> 01:04:17,700
motherland

1142
01:04:17,700 --> 01:04:23,800
because he's come from uh the small town and yeah so so

1143
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:27,533
he's bringing you know his small town with him

1144
01:04:27,533 --> 01:04:28,966
you know the memory

1145
01:04:28,966 --> 01:04:31,100
the things and you know

1146
01:04:32,866 --> 01:04:37,166
so so he is very care about you know

1147
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:41,900
you know the the place he lived and the people there

1148
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:45,466
and he he care about you know

1149
01:04:45,466 --> 01:04:51,100
the what's called specific land for class

1150
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,366
or something yeah so

1151
01:04:53,366 --> 01:04:58,700
he said is what's more terrible than perverting

1152
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:04,366
is the loss of hope so when you when you live in a land

1153
01:05:04,600 --> 01:05:05,900
it's very important

1154
01:05:06,066 --> 01:05:09,200
is people you know live with hope so

1155
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:14,900
if if people lost hope in a in a small place or land

1156
01:05:15,066 --> 01:05:16,533
and it will be you know

1157
01:05:16,533 --> 01:05:21,900
it's very tough or difficult for for the people that live there

1158
01:05:21,933 --> 01:05:23,666
yeah because they

1159
01:05:23,666 --> 01:05:27,066
they had a limited person they had a small place

1160
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,933
and maybe they had you know

1161
01:05:28,933 --> 01:05:32,666
limited you know the the source for for living

1162
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:34,733
or something hmm so so so

1163
01:05:34,733 --> 01:05:37,300
that's why so um yeah

1164
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,100
and also for the for his face or something

1165
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:42,066
and can you feel a bit

1166
01:05:42,066 --> 01:05:45,900
like the the the soil feeling like you know

1167
01:05:46,133 --> 01:05:47,800
some people had the face

1168
01:05:47,966 --> 01:05:49,100
some people like him

1169
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:53,400
because they feel he can be trust do you have this yeah

1170
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,800
you want you want to hug them yeah yeah

1171
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:59,333
because because the soil has this this uh you

1172
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:04,600
know the is it good like you have trust no you know yeah

1173
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:06,966
i'm here i'm there you know

1174
01:06:06,966 --> 01:06:08,766
i understand you know

1175
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:13,000
i just stay there and i just hold them there so so

1176
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:15,466
it's bit like a personal you know

1177
01:06:15,466 --> 01:06:19,200
personality it's better hmm give people feeling like oh

1178
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:23,466
these people looks like can be trust yeah

1179
01:06:23,800 --> 01:06:25,400
hmm yes

1180
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:29,900
and also very stable the interview is very stable hmm yeah yeah

1181
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,100
of course yeah

1182
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:32,300
that's why they they

1183
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:37,566
Donald Trump even warned him become the marga uh leader yeah

1184
01:06:37,566 --> 01:06:38,366
yeah

1185
01:06:39,766 --> 01:06:45,933
yeah but were you already talking about Donald Trump yeah yeah

1186
01:06:45,933 --> 01:06:48,100
of course four on the jelly ones yeah

1187
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:53,166
so the next one is the dumachump the dumachump actually

1188
01:06:53,166 --> 01:06:57,600
also are soil but he is in soil in

1189
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:01,100
soil is fit like you know the garden soil

1190
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:05,500
for example we we have to grow vegetable so so

1191
01:07:05,500 --> 01:07:08,866
we had the soil is very rich sauce

1192
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:11,766
or what's called the

1193
01:07:14,466 --> 01:07:16,333
what's called what it's called

1194
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,766
element something you know the mental element inside

1195
01:07:22,266 --> 01:07:29,200
so you can have a lot of nutrition uh inside yeah

1196
01:07:29,333 --> 01:07:32,800
yeah so so that's that's called insoil so

1197
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:33,166
hmm so

1198
01:07:33,166 --> 01:07:35,333
insoil is is bit

1199
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:39,866
like you can you know the insoil important is you need sun

1200
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,466
you need wood so we have looked the Donald Trump one

1201
01:07:43,466 --> 01:07:47,400
because Donald Trump is born in the sun you know

1202
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,366
the the sun heavily

1203
01:07:49,366 --> 01:07:52,400
you know the the stem yeah

1204
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:56,266
so he's born in the young fire yeah

1205
01:07:56,533 --> 01:07:58,566
so so that's why

1206
01:07:58,566 --> 01:08:02,533
he had a son so you just think if we had a garden garden

1207
01:08:02,533 --> 01:08:03,733
big garden yeah

1208
01:08:04,133 --> 01:08:07,300
then we had the sun shining on me yeah

1209
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,666
and we also had wood

1210
01:08:09,666 --> 01:08:12,800
because he born in the the the month is

1211
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,400
the young wood you know the the the month

1212
01:08:15,666 --> 01:08:20,966
so the the the the heavenly system is is called jiamu is

1213
01:08:20,966 --> 01:08:23,000
the young wood so yeah

1214
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,366
so this soil actually

1215
01:08:25,533 --> 01:08:27,733
they had a wood they had a sun

1216
01:08:27,733 --> 01:08:29,500
so that's why he can grow things

1217
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:32,133
you just think he can grow big family

1218
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:33,933
he can grow you know the country

1219
01:08:33,933 --> 01:08:37,133
he want you know do is without you know yeah

1220
01:08:37,166 --> 01:08:41,400
and he also you know for the garden soil actually

1221
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:45,900
we have to use the hammer you know to dig dig dig dig dig yeah

1222
01:08:46,066 --> 01:08:47,366
then then to move move

1223
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:51,466
you may use a machine to go again that put more things

1224
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:53,766
and then you know know so so

1225
01:08:53,900 --> 01:08:58,900
he will face you know the lots of like uh difficult situation

1226
01:08:58,966 --> 01:08:59,966
but for him

1227
01:08:59,966 --> 01:09:04,466
the garden soil is fine because garden soil is naturally they

1228
01:09:04,533 --> 01:09:09,500
they can you know solve the difficulty so haha yeah

1229
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,700
because that's their nature you know that

1230
01:09:11,700 --> 01:09:13,800
maybe they grow up with like that

1231
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,566
so you have to solve the problem you know you

1232
01:09:16,566 --> 01:09:21,000
you have to face people step on you you know you know yeah

1233
01:09:21,000 --> 01:09:24,000
give you you know what yeah yeah

1234
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,966
frida actually

1235
01:09:25,966 --> 01:09:31,166
i'm curious about um can they can they work

1236
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:33,166
together uh well

1237
01:09:33,366 --> 01:09:34,400
because we know

1238
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:41,733
you just said um jelly ones is a is a yangsuoy right you heard

1239
01:09:41,733 --> 01:09:47,900
he is a wutu okay and Donald Trump is is in soil

1240
01:09:47,900 --> 01:09:55,266
and because he is g to okay and he also said of course

1241
01:09:55,266 --> 01:10:00,566
so can help the the the wood to grow up better but can

1242
01:10:01,933 --> 01:10:07,900
young soil and in soil work with each other

1243
01:10:09,533 --> 01:10:11,800
can they work better they

1244
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:13,066
they can support

1245
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:15,533
support is means like for example

1246
01:10:15,866 --> 01:10:19,200
if you are would and another person is

1247
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:23,666
a would so you beat like a brother and sister so so

1248
01:10:23,666 --> 01:10:25,400
if if you had this power

1249
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:30,100
it means like you had some people behind you to support you so

1250
01:10:30,100 --> 01:10:32,566
it's like a back form you know no

1251
01:10:32,733 --> 01:10:36,566
especially the the young soil is more like a mountain you know

1252
01:10:36,666 --> 01:10:38,966
it's like a strong mountain stand there

1253
01:10:38,966 --> 01:10:42,766
so i'm here and i hold you or something you

1254
01:10:42,766 --> 01:10:46,966
you doing something and hold for you so so yeah

1255
01:10:46,966 --> 01:10:52,466
so it it we can say support but but yeah

1256
01:10:53,166 --> 01:10:58,466
but we always say everything had positive or negative so we

1257
01:10:58,466 --> 01:11:01,333
we just say the positive part yeah

1258
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:05,800
it could be the backbone and the the strong support

1259
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:09,466
and we can see for this election and actually

1260
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:14,166
he is the young very strong support even some people think

1261
01:11:14,166 --> 01:11:17,466
maybe Vince is a good future

1262
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:20,366
president person you know

1263
01:11:20,366 --> 01:11:23,733
maybe because he's young you know he he

1264
01:11:23,900 --> 01:11:26,766
he showing people and people feeling like i

1265
01:11:26,766 --> 01:11:29,966
can trust this person and yeah

1266
01:11:29,966 --> 01:11:31,200
so some people say that

1267
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:35,666
all advances could possible future to be a present yeah

1268
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:36,800
yeah be present

1269
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,666
yeah yeah

1270
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:38,900
so so that's why

1271
01:11:38,900 --> 01:11:44,100
i think definitely they are good groups to support each other

1272
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:44,900
yeah

1273
01:11:45,533 --> 01:11:51,900
okay interesting because now is Donald Trump's administration

1274
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:57,300
so everybody kind of expect what will be happening yeah

1275
01:11:57,466 --> 01:11:58,900
yeah yeah

1276
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:04,000
so from that so we need to talk about the Donald trump's uh

1277
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:09,700

it's a token hmm yeah

1283
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:28,133
and and so so this is like you know the the hammer you know

1284
01:12:28,133 --> 01:12:28,700
that you know

1285
01:12:28,700 --> 01:12:31,133
when you dig the the the soil you know

1286
01:12:31,266 --> 01:12:34,000
hmm heavily use hammer give a hit yeah

1287
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:35,900

1290
01:12:47,966 --> 01:12:49,666
the vice president yeah

1291
01:12:49,733 --> 01:12:54,733
because that time everyone is shocking you see in my memory

1292
01:12:54,733 --> 01:12:57,966
it's like that so actually

1293
01:12:57,966 --> 01:13:00,700
you did give Donald Trump a big hit yeah

1294
01:13:02,133 --> 01:13:06,333
but but Donald Trump is still you know can out of this heat

1295
01:13:06,366 --> 01:13:09,966
because he is garden soil so even you you dig me you know

1296
01:13:09,966 --> 01:13:15,600
i can i can remake it rice or it right again yeah

1297
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:16,933
something like that yeah

1298
01:13:17,066 --> 01:13:20,966
so for the for the pens and the

1299
01:13:20,966 --> 01:13:22,400
viser present

1300
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:24,200
and he had he said

1301
01:13:24,266 --> 01:13:33,133
uh humans see the persons and haven't see the long last future

1302
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:38,400
so so for the mental um yeah

1303
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:41,666
so it's a bit like you know um

1304
01:13:41,866 --> 01:13:43,166
the person had you know

1305
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:45,700
hold very strong personality

1306
01:13:45,900 --> 01:13:46,866
and they usually

1307
01:13:46,866 --> 01:13:51,733
will have you know the view of the the the long future

1308
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,333
so for what what

1309
01:13:54,466 --> 01:13:58,133
so i don't know but for for him standing

1310
01:13:58,133 --> 01:13:58,733
i don't know

1311
01:13:58,733 --> 01:14:04,066
maybe he had his view of the long future for something

1312
01:14:04,066 --> 01:14:04,333
because

1313
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:08,700
the people will separate with the left hand or right hand

1314
01:14:08,700 --> 01:14:12,866
you know if you are really a left hand made you

1315
01:14:12,866 --> 01:14:15,100
your view for your long future

1316
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:19,700
then you decide you know to to to choose make your decision

1317
01:14:19,866 --> 01:14:22,566
and so it it could be possible yeah

1318
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:27,866
but we just know the the the element of the young gun is

1319
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:29,400

01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:08,666
actually inside they they quite happy with themselves like

1352
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,933

really yeah yeah

1358
01:16:22,066 --> 01:16:24,533
so so she is yeah like that

1359
01:16:24,533 --> 01:16:32,300
so so she said the price of anything is the life you pay for it

1360
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,666
but actually

1361
01:16:33,666 --> 01:16:38,000
the the in mental is also more connected with the money you know

1362
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,100
it's a bit like a gold like you

1363
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,866
said it's gold so so

1364
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:44,933
so so they really know

1365
01:16:45,466 --> 01:16:50,900
you know the the the price of things you know the um yeah

1366
01:16:50,900 --> 01:16:52,966
you have to pay for it so um

1367
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:57,066
for example if the person had the element is a lot

1368
01:16:57,066 --> 01:17:00,500
of like the the in mental and actually

1369
01:17:00,733 --> 01:17:03,766
they want to be higher level higher level

1370
01:17:03,766 --> 01:17:06,000
they want to be their life you know

1371
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,666
be looks good you know actually

1372
01:17:08,666 --> 01:17:12,866
good yeah and yeah so they like this feeling you know

1373
01:17:13,066 --> 01:17:15,500
the feeling like you you wear good

1374
01:17:15,766 --> 01:17:18,900
good clothes you eat good things you know

1375
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:21,900
you look pretty and but of course

1376
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:26,800
i don't like cooking hahaha they don't like cooking yeah

1377
01:17:26,866 --> 01:17:28,566
because because for men

1378
01:17:28,566 --> 01:17:31,133
they just want you know people serves you

1379
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:35,366
and it's really difficult if you had a before men

1380
01:17:35,366 --> 01:17:38,733
that had wise is in mental

1381
01:17:38,766 --> 01:17:42,933
and they not really like to actually cooking so

1382
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:44,933
because they don't like fire

1383
01:17:44,933 --> 01:17:49,700
the fire it comes they don't like it just not really you know

1384
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:51,166
enjoy for that yeah

1385
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:54,333
so that's why they definitely they be rich

1386
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:56,700
and they had someone you know cooking for them

1387
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:58,066
or something yeah so

1388
01:17:58,366 --> 01:17:59,733
so it could be yeah

1389
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:04,266
can i see can i see the the mental Thai people

1390
01:18:04,466 --> 01:18:07,166
the the sort of

1391
01:18:08,766 --> 01:18:12,500
the doing the things on purpose strongly of course

1392
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:17,600
everybody everybody's behavior has their own the purpose

1393
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:19,733
but they more strongly right

1394
01:18:20,366 --> 01:18:24,733
because they more care about their fame hmm

1395
01:18:24,733 --> 01:18:25,133
you know

1396
01:18:25,133 --> 01:18:29,466
the the the people uh see how the people see them right

1397
01:18:29,566 --> 01:18:32,000
how the people feel them oh

1398
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:32,666
so that's why

1399
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:36,766
they pretend you know that that that pride you know that good

1400
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,300
in looking hmm you know yeah yeah

1401
01:18:39,300 --> 01:18:41,666
yeah so that will had

1402
01:18:41,666 --> 01:18:47,133
this kind of strong feel that's why they work the the the if you

1403
01:18:47,133 --> 01:18:50,533
your your element has more in you know

1404
01:18:50,533 --> 01:18:54,366
the the mental you more likely to step up for example

1405
01:18:54,366 --> 01:18:57,300
some people do business maybe they sold gold

1406
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,466
or something you know

1407
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,533
hmm the the expensive things yeah

1408
01:19:01,666 --> 01:19:04,566
something like that it's quite often happened yeah

1409
01:19:04,866 --> 01:19:06,700
so people will more like you know

1410
01:19:06,700 --> 01:19:10,066
the the expensive things you know to display

1411
01:19:10,266 --> 01:19:13,900
you know that looks nice or where a lot of you know

1412
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:15,733
these kind of things you know

1413
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:16,733
make you look

1414
01:19:17,133 --> 01:19:19,266
look better or something yeah

1415
01:19:19,533 --> 01:19:21,366
so they really care about that

1416
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:25,066
so they really want to go up and something yeah

1417
01:19:25,166 --> 01:19:26,933
so for the famous

1418
01:19:26,933 --> 01:19:28,766
some famous even China

1419
01:19:28,766 --> 01:19:32,800
the famous actor or something and like Fang

1420
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:35,666
bingbing or something hmm yeah yeah

1421
01:19:35,666 --> 01:19:36,100
yeah yeah

1422
01:19:36,100 --> 01:19:38,400
the in mental quite a lot yeah yeah

1423
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:43,000
hmm yeah so that power is question that's why they want you know

1424
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:43,966
in the public

1425
01:19:43,966 --> 01:19:46,466
they want the people look at them oh

1426
01:19:46,466 --> 01:19:48,266
you look like gold

1427
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:54,333
yeah they want to be the center

1428
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:55,466
right the center

1429
01:19:56,966 --> 01:19:58,466
so that's the one

1430
01:19:59,166 --> 01:20:01,300
hmm then we move on the last two

1431
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:05,466
and hmm so so the the second last

1432
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:08,466
we call the uh young water

1433
01:20:08,533 --> 01:20:09,800
we call任随

1434
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:10,600
任随嗯

1435
01:20:10,966 --> 01:20:12,466
young water嗯

1436
01:20:12,466 --> 01:20:16,300
so so Carrie what do you think the young water could be

1437
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:21,766
what kind of water

1438
01:20:21,766 --> 01:20:23,066
you think is young water

1439
01:20:26,266 --> 01:20:28,966
you just talk about your mom is a water

1440
01:20:28,966 --> 01:20:30,000
type so

01:20:30,466 --> 01:20:33,733
of course i know the water type that means can

1442
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,400
they have survivability

1443
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:44,400
and they can change when the situation changes

1444
01:20:44,566 --> 01:20:50,400
for example some water is drip water my mom is drip water

1445

1446
01:20:52,500 --> 01:20:54,066

01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:56,066
i see yeah

1448
01:20:56,266 --> 01:20:59,733
but some water is very big huge

1449
01:21:00,733 --> 01:21:01,366
so do you think

1450
01:21:01,366 --> 01:21:04,066
what kind of water is big and huge

1451
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:07,200
but you know water people

1452
01:21:07,200 --> 01:21:09,300
when people think about waters

1453
01:21:10,866 --> 01:21:13,333

you have the heart very openly you know

1478
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:27,300
it's you know it's big and something like that yeah so

1479
01:22:28,133 --> 01:22:28,600
yeah so

1480
01:22:28,600 --> 01:22:32,600
Steven Benon said a good judge of Thailand

1481
01:22:33,200 --> 01:22:35,500
may the Trump president

1482
01:22:36,300 --> 01:22:37,100
yeah

1483
01:22:37,933 --> 01:22:40,333
i see young young

1484
01:22:40,333 --> 01:22:43,900
you know the the the young water that had a big goal

1485
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:48,566
it's like you know the we can see the sea they will know uh

1486
01:22:48,666 --> 01:22:50,100
in China we call the uh

1487
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:54,500
dajiang dongqi means the water will running running

1488
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:56,533
running to the east yeah

1489
01:22:56,966 --> 01:22:57,866
hmm yeah

1490
01:22:58,100 --> 01:23:00,266
so so probably yeah

1491
01:23:00,266 --> 01:23:01,800
i think that yeah

1492
01:23:01,800 --> 01:23:05,166
so for for him definitely had big water

1493
01:23:05,466 --> 01:23:09,266
because we can see he's born in the water yeah

1494
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:13,600
and he's born in the water months and he's born in the water day

1495
01:23:14,066 --> 01:23:20,566
oh so so in his element he got four water hmm yeah

1496
01:23:20,566 --> 01:23:22,366
we just think we only uh

1497
01:23:22,666 --> 01:23:25,400
the bus only had eight you know the eight

1498
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:26,766
hmm eight uh

1499
01:23:26,766 --> 01:23:30,000
the the heaven earth you know the friend

1500
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:34,800
and and he had the full half is water

1501
01:23:35,133 --> 01:23:37,000
it means pure water right

1502
01:23:37,133 --> 01:23:39,666
yeah so you just think how big the water is

1503
01:23:39,733 --> 01:23:42,766
and he also he had inward and young water

1504
01:23:42,766 --> 01:23:49,066
but he's uh the the you know the the fat owner is young water so

1505
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:50,100
that's why so

1506
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:51,866
we understand yeah

1507
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:53,866
so so how he is

1508
01:23:54,166 --> 01:23:55,500
and so we we

1509
01:23:55,500 --> 01:23:56,800
we can understand

1510
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,700
why he want doing the big thing

1511
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:02,333
he want to join the you know the the the little water

1512
01:24:02,566 --> 01:24:05,066
and become the the big water so

1513
01:24:05,066 --> 01:24:06,100
it's just like uh

1514
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:10,266
he always says what a老百姓yeah

1515
01:24:10,500 --> 01:24:15,733
yeah he care about the every overage people yeah yeah

1516
01:24:15,733 --> 01:24:16,933
in every individual

1517
01:24:16,933 --> 01:24:20,566
whatever this person is poor or you know the situation

1518
01:24:20,566 --> 01:24:22,266

1519
01:24:22,266 --> 01:24:26,866
or something he care about you know the yeah each job yeah yeah

1520
01:24:26,866 --> 01:24:27,666
something right

1521
01:24:27,666 --> 01:24:32,133
and he wanted to keep the the whole job together like he

1522
01:24:32,166 --> 01:24:34,533
he organized a margar yeah

1523
01:24:35,066 --> 01:24:37,200
hmm it's something like the people you know he

1524
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:40,766
he makes the people together what they do they

1525
01:24:40,766 --> 01:24:42,666
they want Donald Trump

1526
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:44,533
make Trump president

1527
01:24:44,533 --> 01:24:46,400
that's his goal yeah

1528
01:24:46,766 --> 01:24:48,100
big goal yeah yeah

1529
01:24:48,133 --> 01:24:53,133
so that that's his young world story now now

1530
01:24:53,133 --> 01:24:55,500
i understand okay so

1531
01:24:57,666 --> 01:24:59,700
who is the last one who

1532
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,966
is the last one

1533
01:25:13,766 --> 01:25:15,200
really okay

1534
01:25:22,733 --> 01:25:23,800
you mean in water

1535
01:25:24,266 --> 01:25:28,800
frieda sorry in water that means in water is drip water yeah

1536
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:31,000
in water is drip water okay yeah

1537
01:25:31,266 --> 01:25:34,466
for example like in the morning you go outside

1538
01:25:34,466 --> 01:25:36,966
you see on the grass that has a little little

1539
01:25:37,266 --> 01:25:38,666
you know the shining water

1540
01:25:38,666 --> 01:25:41,566
hmm that's all called in water

1541
01:25:42,100 --> 01:25:45,333
i see water you should like put them like a rain

1542
01:25:45,500 --> 01:25:48,366
know the rain coming a little drip little drip

1543
01:25:48,366 --> 01:25:52,333
that's also part of the in water yeah

1544
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:53,533
hmm so so

1545
01:25:53,966 --> 01:25:54,600
in water

1546
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:58,966
is you have to combine with this one that one you know the

1547
01:25:58,966 --> 01:26:02,300
and and they will change they are sharing you know up down up

1548
01:26:02,300 --> 01:26:06,666
down something but depends on what what they mean for example

1549
01:26:06,666 --> 01:26:11,166
if they made the fire the definitely what goes up and yeah

1550
01:26:11,166 --> 01:26:14,466
and why he is good with

1551
01:26:15,766 --> 01:26:19,700
Donald Trump because Donald Trump is the soil but actually

1552
01:26:19,700 --> 01:26:21,800
he needs water yeah

1553
01:26:22,066 --> 01:26:23,766
you just think Donald Trump

1554
01:26:23,866 --> 01:26:27,166
had Stephen Bannon in the water to help him

1555
01:26:27,166 --> 01:26:31,100
and had the robbed Candy in the water to help him

1556
01:26:31,100 --> 01:26:33,700
and Donald Trump also needed the wood

1557
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:36,266
because if you are so you want the water

1558
01:26:36,266 --> 01:26:37,966
and you want the growth in so

1559
01:26:37,966 --> 01:26:39,766
so Elon Musk help you so

1560
01:26:39,766 --> 01:26:44,500
that's why they are a very great team for Donald Trump yeah

1561
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:47,166
freedom made a circle now actually

1562
01:26:47,166 --> 01:26:51,166
we can connect every point together to understand

1563
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:54,466
why we talking about the five elements

1564
01:26:54,466 --> 01:26:57,533
and the buzz right now hmm yeah yeah yeah

1565
01:26:57,533 --> 01:26:58,566
yeah so so

1566
01:26:58,566 --> 01:27:00,966
that's why i saw the ah yeah

1567
01:27:00,966 --> 01:27:04,666
the the the Robert committee and you when when you see

1568
01:27:04,666 --> 01:27:06,700
he's talking so what do you want to do

1569
01:27:07,066 --> 01:27:08,500
he want to change

1570
01:27:09,133 --> 01:27:10,566
he want to change things

1571
01:27:10,966 --> 01:27:13,966
he want to change medical system he want to change

1572
01:27:13,966 --> 01:27:16,566
you know the the world organization

you want to change lots of things yeah

1574
01:27:19,066 --> 01:27:21,533
so he want American be healthy again

1575
01:27:21,533 --> 01:27:25,766
because you just think drip water the harder

1576
01:27:25,766 --> 01:27:31,000
the uh the type is they can save life

1577
01:27:32,966 --> 01:27:33,900
without water

1578
01:27:34,666 --> 01:27:40,666
nothing can survive so water has important you know the source

1579
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:44,800
right they want to save the life they happily to see

1580
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:48,933
you know the life things for the like my mom yeah

1581
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,500
she happily see what a duckling baby

1582
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,966
you know everything is alive

1583
01:27:54,066 --> 01:27:58,733
and she is happy to see and to help yeah so

1584
01:27:58,733 --> 01:28:02,566
so for for him is the same you know he he

1585
01:28:02,566 --> 01:28:06,266
he sees the the American children suffer

1586
01:28:06,333 --> 01:28:08,266
he see lots of people suffer

1587
01:28:08,266 --> 01:28:12,533
and he want to save this person he want to give them you know

1588
01:28:12,533 --> 01:28:15,000
the support to change them you know

1589
01:28:15,133 --> 01:28:18,066
it's it's something like that so so

1590
01:28:18,066 --> 01:28:18,900
that's why so

1591
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:23,666
he say the world is indeed full of suffering

1592
01:28:24,766 --> 01:28:28,266
hmm sorrow ignorance and violence

1593
01:28:28,666 --> 01:28:31,866
but hmm never feel depressed

1594
01:28:32,100 --> 01:28:37,800
because you think there is nothing you can do about it

1595
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:39,600
so that's why

1596
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:43,100
he thinks i can do something about it

1597
01:28:43,533 --> 01:28:47,866
because you lost hope and of course

1598
01:28:47,866 --> 01:28:48,933
you do nothing

1599
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:52,866
yeah yeah so

1600
01:28:53,200 --> 01:28:56,200
so i think so yeah

1601
01:28:56,200 --> 01:28:57,566
that's today's yeah

1602
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,166
the end of our first episode actually

1603
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:03,333
the last minute the last

1604
01:29:03,333 --> 01:29:05,733
so i don't need to remain the free the free

1605
01:29:05,733 --> 01:29:12,933
already gave us the the the was that hmm

1606
01:29:13,300 --> 01:29:16,900
the reason why we want to do this podcast right

1607
01:29:17,266 --> 01:29:18,666
i actually yeah

1608
01:29:18,700 --> 01:29:21,266
she she already told us and actually

1609

more feedback let's uh

1611
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,266
let's uh communicate that's community

1612
01:29:31,266 --> 01:29:32,333
i i don't think

1613
01:29:32,333 --> 01:29:33,600
there's a huge uh

1614
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:37,133
gap between the eastern people and western people

1615
01:29:37,166 --> 01:29:40,466
i think we can talk with each other uh

1616
01:29:40,466 --> 01:29:44,066
once uh we know what uh want to do right

1617
01:29:44,866 --> 01:29:48,366
